Wear a mask

If you are not fully vaccinated and aged 2 or older, you should wear a mask in indoor public places.
In general, you do not need to wear a mask in outdoor settings.
In areas with high numbers of COVID-19 cases, consider wearing a mask in crowded outdoor settings 
and for activities with close contact with others who are not fully vaccinated. People who have a 
condition or are taking medications that weaken their immune system may not be fully protected even 
if they are fully vaccinated. They should continue to take all precautions recommended for unvaccinated 
people, including wearing a well-fitted mask, until advised otherwise by their healthcare provider.
If you are fully vaccinated, to maximize protection from the Delta variant and prevent possibly 
spreading it to others, wear a mask indoors in public if you are in an area of substantial or high 
transmission. If you are fully vaccinated, see When You’ve Been Fully Vaccinated. Wearing a mask over 
your nose and mouth is required on planes, buses, trains, and other forms of public transportation 
traveling into, within, or out of the United States and while indoors at U.S. transportation hubs 
such as airports and stations. Travelers are not required to wear a mask in outdoor areas of a conveyance 
(like on open deck areas of a ferry or the uncovered top deck of a bus).

Wash your hands often
Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds especially after you have been in a public place, or after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.
It’s especially important to wash:
Before eating or preparing food
Before touching your face
After using the restroom
After leaving a public place
After blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing
After handling your mask
After changing a diaper
After caring for someone sick
After touching animals or pets
If soap and water are not readily available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Cover all surfaces of your hands and rub them together until they feel dry.
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.
